Things to check:

- do any fields need to be declared final?

- do any fields need to be declared volatile?

- do any methods need to be synchronized?

- do any fields need to be AtomicXXX?

- add synchronization annotations? (@GuardedBy, @ThreadSafe, @Immutable, etc.)

- are any objects improperly constructed (i.e. publish "this")?
